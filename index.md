## To change your life, change your daily habits 

A firm believer in the power of daily habits to change a life, I developed Daily Dash — a mobile application that empowers **users across all walks of life** to achieve their goals, from becoming more skilled at public speaking to adopting a healthier diet. 

Featuring a fun, games-like points and awards system, push notifications, and a database of common goals from which users can draw inspiration, Daily Dash encourages, excites, and engages users every step of the way. 

Dynamically-rendered forms, the ability to complete any task in less than 5 taps, and a very carefully chosen shade of aqua green (#46BFAC!) all lend to a user-interface that's intuitive, inviting, and most importantly, **inclusive.**

With the game-like motivators appealing to younger audiences, the uncomplicated user-interface geared towards older users, and the flexible forms and push notifications attracting busy, highly self-motivated users, Daily Dash suits any and all lifestyles - regardless of whether users operate in 12hr time or 24hr time.   

Never again will New Year's Resolutions be left unfulfilled!

## App Overview 

After logging in, users are greeted with their dashboard, which lists all the sub-goals users need to complete for that day. At the time listed, users will receive a **real-time push notification** regarding their goal. As users check off completed goals, their number of goals completed increase and reflects on the profile screen. As users complete goals, they accumulate awards and level-up. Below the user's name on the profile screen is their latest award earned! On the profile screen, users can also select their preferred time mode - 12 hour time or 24 hour time.  <br>

<br>
From the goals screen shown above, users can add a new goal, browse the catalog of common goals, and press on a goal to view its subgoals. The catalog of common goals lists common goals from which users can draw inspiration. Users can easily add a common goal to their personal repertoire by selecting a common goal and pressing "Add Goal". <br>

<br>
From the goals screen, users can also press on a goal to see its details. From the goal detail screen, users can edit or delete the selected goal. Both the edit and add goal pages also have a "Get Suggestion" button, which, when pressed, offers users a sub-goal suggestion, generated using a **complex cosine-similarity algorithm** in the backend. <br>

<br>
From the profile screen shown in the first row, users can access their awards and log out. Logging out will redirect users to the welcome screen and sign in screen where users can sign in using **Google Authentication.**  <br>
