# DailyDash

## To change your life, change your daily habits 

We believe that small efforts everyday can accumulate to yield life-changing results. Armed with this core belief, our team created Daily Dash to empower **users across all walks of life** to achieve their goals, whether its to become skilled at public speaking or to adopt a healthier diet. 

Featuring a fun, games-like points and awards system, push notifications, and a database of common goals from which users can draw inspiration, Daily Dash encourages, excites, and engages users every step of the way. 

Dynamically-rendered forms, the ability to complete any task in less than 5 taps, and the perfect shade of aqua green (#46BFAC!), meticulously selected, all lend to a user-interface that's intuitive, inviting, and most importantly, inclusive.

With the game-like motivators appealing to younger audiences, the uncomplicated user-interface geared towards older users, and the flexible forms and push notifications attracting busy, highly self-motivated users, Daily Dash suits any and all lifestyles. Even more, users can choose either 12-hour time or 24-hour time mode!    

Never again will New Year's Resolutions be left unfulfilled!

## App Overview 

After logging in, users are greeted with their dashboard, which lists all the sub-goals users need to complete for that day. At the time listed, users will receive a **real-time push notification** regarding their goal. As users check off completed goals, their number of goals completed increase and reflects on the profile screen. As users complete goals, they accumulate awards and level-up. Below the user's name on the profile screen is their latest award earned! On the profile screen, users can also select their preferred time mode - 12 hour time or 24 hour time.  <br>

From the goals screen shown above, users can add a new goal, browse the catalog of common goals, and press on a goal to view its subgoals. The catalog of common goals lists common goals from which users can draw inspiration. Users can easily add a common goal to their personal repertoire by selecting a common goal and pressing "Add Goal". <br>

From the goals screen, users can also press on a goal to see its details. From the goal detail screen, users can edit or delete the selected goal. Both the edit and add goal pages also have a "Get Suggestion" button, which, when pressed, offers users a sub-goal suggestion, generated using a **complex cosine-similarity algorithm** in the backend. <br>
